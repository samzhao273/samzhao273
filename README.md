Hello, I'm Sam (he/him) ðŸ‘‹
I am looking for internships for Summer 2024. Feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin or email (samzhao273@gmail.com)!

I am a fourth yr Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia.

Previously was a Software Engineer Intern at SAP wokring on the User Support SAC team.

I use GitHub to track my learning process as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during my learning process as well as my projects on this GitHub account.
Thank you for reading!
