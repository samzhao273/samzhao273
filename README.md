Hello, I'm Sam (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth yr Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia.

Currently a Software Engineer Intern at Vial working on the EPD team. 

Previously was a Software Engineer Intern at SAP working on the User Support SAC team.

I use GitHub to track my learning process as well as all my projects, so there may be repositories that I've made during my learning process as well as my projects on this GitHub account.
Thank you for reading!
